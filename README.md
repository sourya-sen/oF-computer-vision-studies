Personal studies in computer vision using openFrameworks and ofxCv as a lot of the resources and examples out there seem to be out of date with the latest oF version (0.10.x+). For posterity, will be maintaining a log here, in case it comes in handy for anyone else out there but I cannot promise that these will be the most efficient way of doing things. Feel free to follow along and send PRs in case you notice anything untoward.

Dependencies / [openFrameworks 0.10.x](https://openFrameworks.cc), [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv).
